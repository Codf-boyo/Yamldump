title: What was your biggest investment regret?
text: Hey everyone, let's have a no-judgment zone discussion about our biggest
  investment fails. We've all made mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes can be
  costly. Sharing our experiences can help us learn from each other, avoid
  future pitfalls, and build a stronger understanding of investing. So, what's
  your *biggest investment regret?*

    text: Scottish mortgage investment trust - a well know firm with a good track
      record that took a right beating in 2023. Continued to DCA but at my worst
      point, was down about 45%. It's had a good run this year so far but like
      the rest of the market, it's being propped up by volatile tech stocks.
      Still about 10% down after holding for 2 years.

    text: I am new in the investing world. Apart from that, I should get involved in
      share investments years ago, but not recently, which I count for regret,
      to be more specific on topic I would say nvidia before that extreme raised
      happen. So basically, before start investing I wanted to educate myself as
      much as possible, so when I want it to test my knowledges without
      investing real money I analysed nvdia stock and my analyse was okay I
      would say but still I didn't put real money, because I felt that I am not
      ready. To choose nvidia for my first testing analysis wasn't just an
      acedtenlty pick up from the sea of companies. I have liked nvidia since
      early 00s when my video game always started with their logo and that
      specific addictive voice that says - Nvidia.

          valuation is indecent to each investor- but that never translates with
          Tesla. Only social media good news and his tweets or presence in world

      Selling a whole position to take profit. Tesla, Apple and the airlines

      Portfolio has been -50% for 2 years even with 8 months of dollar cost
      averaging. I was greedy on the EVs and made a terrible gamble with the
      Chargepoint merger, that’s -80% alone now. I’ll hold these stocks 40 years
      if I have to, but won’t through good money after them anymore. DCA
      stopped, focussing on other assets.

          @Rollosdad market has contracted a little too, so be aware of timing

          Intelligent Investor is a dry book, I'd also urge you to consider
          Graham rewrote the book and the formulas multiple times when he was
          alive, so what he would use today and back then might not be the same.

          Limit order: the order will only go through at a certain price that
          you set so you know exactly what price you’ll get and doesn’t go
          through if the stock never reaches that price

    text: Failing to stick to my investment plan and end up getting greedier, after
      starting investing on T212. Before, I was using a different broker in
      which I had to pay more transaction costs, especially for individual
      stocks. This forced me to do due diligence and buy larger stakes into
      fewer companies. Now in this platform, which I joined because of low costs
      for individual stocks, I got lazy and more greedy than I was before. I
      ended up now with many pies and small stakes in too many companies, many
      of which I don't even know much about. Does anyone have tips on
      simplifying a portfolio and investment strategy, when the stocks (that you
      did not really intend to buy but got via pie investments) are in the red,
      and don't know if they are now under/overvalued?

          @Facaiya Discounted Cash Flow, which probably doesn't help either! It
          basically means for a set period for time you project the future cash
          flows of the company and then discount them to the present date (to
          give you a margin of safety). 


          A reverse DCF, as the name suggests, works in the opposite way and
          tells you what growth is currently priced into the stock and your job
          is to determine whether they can achieve that growth.

          @IngeniousInvestor I've given a bit of a tip earlier, but the easiest
          way I've found is to order the stocks from 1 to whatever but crucially
          the order is from your best ideas to your worst or the ones you have
          the most conviction in to the least. Then get rid of all the ones you
          no longer want.


          Best way to quickly value something that I've found is to use a
          reverse DCF. You can see what growth is already priced in compare it
          against current growth and see if it makes sense. I've got one I
          regularly give away if you want a copy.

      P.s in my bead the money is lost, that’s why I never sold to pull anything
      back, only invest what you can afford to lose

      My first was when i first started; i approached this like its some kind of
      money glitch. Literally spammed market buys and sells on the “Top Movers”
      and sold the second it made a penny profit… worked for the first 3 or 4
      trades then cost me £675. 


      The second, and probably my biggest regret, was going all in on 3x Nvidia
      just after it came back down to 130 after it first touched 140. Ended up
      down £3k but managed to make that back through detaching emotion from the
      “lost” cash and carrying out a DCA process. 


      Safe to say, too lessons well learned!

          @Lexu I've just exited Kering myself for LVMH. My worry is that it's
          over reliant on one brand and that brand isn't doing very well at the
          moment. It's a very interesting rate sensitive business though, so it
          could do if rates fall sufficiently. You've also got the overhang from
          the Chinese economy not doing so well - a key client of Kerings.


          My answer is in short, it might do, but I'm not betting on it tbh

          What do you think of kering? It’s pretty down right now, do you think
          it will go back to 300 in next year.

      At the end of Covid I bought £5k Cineworld. I thought having held on so
      long people would rush out for movies and popcorn again. I bought at
      fractions of the dollar and when it went down further I bought another
      £1k. I had millions of shares! But as the Owner said later, during Covid,
      no “Tentpole movies” were made. The expected return of moviegoers didn’t
      happen, and it went bust.! Lost the lot! 

      So much for Warren Buffet saying, “When there’s blood on the ground, BUY!
      The stock market always comes back!” Ho! Ho! Ho! Mines Antofagasta, BHP,
      and Rio covered that in ‘23.

          @Mompara I think to be fair to Buffett he's talking about the stock
          market as a whole, not individual companies.


          I think Cineworld was always a ticking time bomb because of the debt
          pile, if COVID didn't get it inflation and the subsequent rise in the
          cost of borrowing would have done.

      My biggest regret is only buying small amounts of shares instead of large
      amounts. I have Nvidia at £300 before the stock split and PLTR for £12!!!
      Sold them both for about double what I put in. 


      LEAVE IT IN THERE

      My biggest mistake is buying Tesco,  I bought the shares in 2013 since the
      Horse Meat Scandal.

      In short to cost avg I spent an altogether £9k now value is £7k with
      inflation rate. I nearly lost half the value. I'm still not sure what to
      do with it

          @PositionHunter they has big problems. But now FDA approved two
          genetic therapies. But only USA and now they need to constitute
          clinics and sign contracts with insurance to cover the treatment worth
          2.8 and 3 million $. Now the money needs to start rolling.

          —————————

          While Zynteglo, bluebird's treatment for beta thalassemia, costs $2.8
          million, Skysona, its therapy for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, is
          priced at $3 million. The gene therapies each became the most
          expensive drug in U.S. history when they were approved a month apart
          in 2022. (fiercepharma.com)

        text: "@PositionHunter I’ve sold at a loss on a few things and not regretted it
          at all even when it did go up a bit again - with CLSK the amount I
          have left in is a lot less than the percentage I’ve lost! I’ve noticed
          people are recommending Cleanspark again lately but it’s gone from
          something like $30 down to $7-8, so I’d be very surprised if it ever
          goes up to those figures again. I obviously wish I’d sold when it was
          at a good profit but I think as beginners we sometimes have to get
          burned to really focus on creating a more disciplined approach to our
          portfolios. There are so many content creators out there that will say
          that certain tiny stocks are set to become the next Nvidia and attempt
          to charge you a fortune to tell you what they are - it’s a very bad
          idea to listen to them as you can usually figure them out for yourself
          or get them on YouTube. No regrets, you just have to learn from your
          mistakes and keep pushing on."

      $ARVL Arrival, the UK electric van company. I lost so much I can’t repeat
      it or I’ll go into a depression.

      I kept following it down, ignoring that they were in too many
      things:?vans, buses, ride share, robotaxis, electric planes, racing cars,
      and even a secret flying truck project, that my nephew, an engineer there,
      was working on.

      Too short a cash ramp.

      And incredibly difficult to move from prototype to production.

      Lesson: take a punt for sure, but diversify and hold blue chip stock as
      well.

      My biggest regrets,


      Not knowing about investing and fearing that I would lose money. I had
      about £100k inheritance, and only invested using my ISA, and ONLY
      investing £10k to test the water and learn how it all worked.  Meanwhile
      the rest of my saving sat doing nothing, or in a 4-5% account.


      Meanwhile the £10k I did invest made 30%.


      I was afraid to invest, because everyone kept saying the market is going
      to crash. So I held tight clutching the money.


      So more recently I was so sick of everyone making massive gains, so I went
      ‘almost’ all in, at the end of July this year, and a week later the bottom
      fell out of everythink.  


      I kept trying to buy the dip, but the dip kept f**kin’ dipping, until I
      ran out of cash, and the bottom was nowhere in sight.  Really
      disheartening.


      Also buying Intel, Rivian, and NIO, only to see them fall by about 50%,
      then I sold them at a loss (-£3500), to double down on Nvidia before
      earning, only to have NVDA fall even further. 


      Now I understand how powerful ETF’s can be.

          @Downandupsparemoneyonly I was so sick of seeing Rivian in the red,
          they had a few short windows when they was in the green, but instead
          of selling like I should have after VW, I got greedy/curious and
          wanted to see if it would run, but like always, Rivian sank back under
          water a few days later.  


          I’m sure they will do well over time, but I was so tired of carrying
          them.

          @PositionHunter The sensible answer would be yes! But wheres the fun
          in that!? 🤪


          I just wasn’t very knowledgeable. I remember people talking about
          Palantir when it was about $6. But I didn’t have a clue what Palantir
          was… I thought they were on about Peloton! 🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️


          I remember seeing NVDA for $500 before the split, and people saying it
          was over-valued. 


          So I ignored NVDA and bought Intel at $30 like a dummy.  $30’s cheaper
          that $500, right?!  Doh!!!


          Then FOMO made me buy 10 shares of NVDA after the stock split! I was
          always too slow, making decisions after the train left the station.


          So this time I decided to move early… and still got screwed by the 5th
          of August tumble. 😫

          @DCarreira sure - although definitely consider that you could earn
          that 30€ somewhere else, in a company you believe in. 


          Making it back doesn't have to be in the same company you lost it in.


          As per my story below - here's my painful sale...and this is only
          2/3rds of it.

      One thing I wish I knew before investing was a quick check of the key
      investment document and check for an entry charge. I spent £250 on an
      initial fee investing in a mixed asset fund with an enticingly low ongoing
      charge figure. However, I was going investment mad and completing fund
      switches every hour until I settled. I’ve also spent a few hundred pounds
      on fund switch charges.


      Lesson to take away is pick your investments after lots of research and
      leave it to grow, one ETF over one in a similar category might only differ
      by a few halves of a point in the short term so you’re only hurting your
      fund value.

          @Karthikshastri ok, so this always works for me when consolidating, it
          seems simple - but I didn't think of it until someone told me. 


          So list out every stock you have in a spreadsheet. Now number them
          from 1 to however many stocks you have but crucially, number 1 is the
          stock you think is your best idea and that you have the most
          conviction in and go through the list until you've identified what are
          your best and worst ideas. Following that - cull everything below the
          number of stocks you want to hold.


          It's ruthless, but it works.

      NVIDIA - I held it since 2017 and convinced myself to sell at $230 pre

      Expensify - US based cloud expense management company. Bought in 2022. I
      continued to add to the stock through 2023 even with revenue on he
      decline. Outspoken CEO, poor financial performance, not maintaining user

          ago and only 4 years ago I started to make real money, prior to that I
          was working for peanuts, was a rookie who finished University not a
          long time ago, I was also paying rent so life was a bit too rough to
          invest.

      My first ever buy, Tracon Pharma. Only £20 to dip my toe in the market
      because they were doing cancer cure research. Thought, if they come up
      with something, I'll retire. 3 months later, not even traded on the stock
      market anymore.

      Seconded by getting a free porsche share when I signed up, tried to avg it
      down, hit the wrong button and bought 10 shares instead of 10 pounds
      worth. Ended up with 800 pounds worth just before the share price went to
      lower than it's ipo price.

      Bought £300 in shares of a company called meta data a few months back when
      it jumped. I thought this would be an opportunity to ride it as it jumps
      and sell out when it peaks however the second I bought it it crashed
      literally. 


      I ended up cutting my losses a month later £200 down fortunately I sold
      just at the right time as it was delisted a few days later

      1) not starting earlier.

      2) buying individual stocks

      2a) trying to find ‘the next big thing’

      3) trying to time the market by buying and selling too often, and trying
      ‘to take a profit’


      Started investing 12 years ago so obviously nothing I could do about point
      1.  

      Rectified 2 to 3 after about 18 months.

          @PositionHunter yeah pretty much. I hold way too much Lloyd’s that I
          bought when it fell to 29p in 2008 (something like 71,000 and change
          shares) and also 5% of my isa in a REIT (British Land) just to get
          exposure to property. 


          I don’t reinvest anything into Lloyd’s and will buy more of the ETF’s
          to get the % down that I own.


          Reason for mostly going the etf route was I realised I didn’t know
          what I was doing and decided to take what the markets give me.


          Great post by the way and I have really enjoyed reading the honest
          responses.


          In some ways I’m happy I made mistakes at the start because I learned
          from them and imagine making mistakes with a 6 figure portfolio - the
          mistakes could be devastating.

      My biggest regret was buying IAG..

      I’ve had them two and a half years now.

      Have to get them up to 1.97…

      They were on the climb, so I dropped £58k on them in three lots…..then the
      Ukraine war started..literally two days later….went through the floor…

      My friend was on holiday at the time, so didn’t bother buying them…he
      waited around two weeks, then dropped £20k on them, since that day, he’s
      made over £42k in profit by buying and selling, sometimes in the same day.

      The best he made was just over £11k in ten days while on holiday in
      Thailand..


      I bought Vodafone last December, 6th?…dropped £4K on them….15 minutes
      later, and I mean 15 minutes later, they crashed….had to wait until May to
      get my money back….

      Bought Rolls Royce a couple of years ago, made £300 in three days on a £3k
      investment, sold and was very pleased with it……the following day they went
      up something like 12p upon opening…..

      If you ever want financial advice….don’t come to me!

      Thankfully not much invested but I had been thinking of putting a lot more
      into them. Still not teally sure why it has performed so abysmally.
      Passenger numbers are healthy etc. A mystery and a good reason to buy ETFs

      The horror and uncertainty of the war is one thing but the nuances of the

          Kostyantyn Zhevago is the majority shareholder of Ferrexpo, but the
          Ukrainian Justice Ministry's State Enforcement Service has placed
          restrictions on 49.3% of shares in Ferrexpo Poltava Mining. The
          restrictions were imposed to satisfy a debt claim from the National
          Bank of Ukraine to Zhevago.

          significant dips for the dividend. $MPW's book value is way over their
          market cap and they've made some good moves over the past couple of
          months to reduce the impact from Steward. With short interest at close
          to 40% and having followed the soap opera for the past 12 months I
          like the possibility of a squeeze. At only 25% of my portfolio I'm

      with Balfour Beatty but it all went wrong and after that this company just
      went bust my biggest investment loss of around £500. I had invested £600..
      At the time of the attempted acquisition, it didn’t make sense why they
      would buy Balfour Beatty which at the time we’re struggling with contract
      loss. I thought maybe there were time to take advantage of Balfour Beatty
      struggles but in reality they were actually trying to save themselves and
      Balford Beatty figured that out and rejected the leaderships of Carillon.
      my biggest mistake on T212 was MPW where I’d invested £40 and lost £25.

      take losses and make mistakes to understand how it works and more
      importantly how you work as a person as the majority of it comes down to

      I bought croda when it first dipped 7%. I was relatively new at investing
      and rushed into buying it without doing any proper research. It's since
      dipped another 23%.


      I only put about £130 into it, so I'm not down much, but it was still a
      lesson for me on not rushing into purchases, always do your research.


      I don't mind the company itself and am happy to hold, but I recon it'll be
      a few years before I get back to even on it.

          @DaveHarling I think Steve and I have been correct on Croda so far.
          We've flipped from there's no reason to buy this to now it's getting
          interesting.


          It's a good company, knows how to navigate cycles.

      Coca Cola, one of the few stocks I bought, simply, because I was
      recommended to buy. I did not have a reason to buy, it was at record high
      at the time, it went down... It taught me many good lessons, so I am not
      sure I regret it that much and with the dividends I essentially came out
      without a loss.


      Otherwise the big regrets are often not holding. Not, in that I do not
      make profit, but that I do not make enough. I am like: "oh I am making a
      few extra dollars let's sell" even if the stock was in the negative for
      months or years.

      Some investment trust purchases have been absolute shockers. I kind of
      thought that professional managers would really know their onions so put
      faith in these two garbage cans.


      HGEN

      DGI9


      HGEN is a hydrogen fund which has now been in a two year downtrend. DGI9
      (digital infrastructure) was a cataclysmic management disaster. Sold both
      earlier this year for a substantial loss. Lesson learned. Never assume
      someone else knows what they're doing.

      Tesla without a shadow of a doubt. And before the Tesla fans jump on me I
      just want to say that it was my very first investment and I didn't really
      know what I was doing. I had no idea how volatile the stock was going to
      be, on the Tesla forum the amount of anti Elon political activists was
      depressing. I quickly realised that it wasn't the stock for me simply
      because I hadn't built up a stable part of my portfolio yet. Luckily
      before I sold it I had learned that panic selling is not a good idea and
      so I waited until it went up to just over what I paid for it and I sold. 


      I'm not saying that I won't buy back in again sometime because I might,
      but I just don't think it was a stock for somebody who was actually trying
      to build a portfolio with a bit of stability in somewhere. I've only been
      at this two months but it's getting there. 

      Equally, $Nvidia, which has its own share of aggressive fanboys, has been
      a big disappointment. Over hyped and a pathetic dividend and I can't
      afford to sell and take the loss so I've just got a hang on to it which is
      annoying because I'm sure the money could be better invested elsewhere.
      Now I really will get jumped on for saying that because the fan boys get
      extremely upset if anybody disagrees with them about how fantastic it is.
      I'm not saying it's not fantastic but it's definitely not the sort of
      stock I want. Again,  too volatile.

          @PositionHunter I suppose I am still finding my style but my portfolio
          is far from satisfactory. That's because I am over invested in tech
          stock and under-invested in low-volatility stock.  In the case of
          NVIDIA I have to wait until the stock recovers before I sell.  That's
          frustrating as it could be a while. In my previous line of work you
          learn that nothing's ever as good as it could be and you keep on
          trying to improve it. So I suspect it is with investing.  


          By the way didn't you say something in your thread starter about "no
          judgement". 


          Further up the thread, this is what I got just for even mentioning the
          company. Bloody little fan-boys! 🙄

          with the kind of dividend they've decided to dish out after having
          such good results (even though they didn't quite hit market

          @LauraBlueMoon that's great though right? From one Tesla investment
          you learned three things:


          - Check user sentiment

          - Don't panic sell

          - Heavy volatility is not for you


          Nvidia is harder to analyse - because it's very much in the moment,
          anything could happen from here.

      Rite-Aid. Speculated that of the two buyout outcomes it was a binary
      yes/no and both would end up being beneficial for me based on the price I
      bought in at.


      A - it would be approved, and Walgreens would pay me $6 for my shares


      B - It was not approved, and the shares would still likely be above my
      buying price and being free from the bureaucracy of waiting for an
      acquisition would help the share price.


      Turns out that there was a secret 3rd option where Walgreens ended up
      buying a smaller number of stores that they didn;t need approval for. Of
      course, these were also the best locations of stores.


      Shares plummeted (as they should, it was a terrible deal for $RAD
      holders). Always sticks out in my mind as an example in my mind of really
      poor shareholder stewardship by management

      😂 I've got two. One was Arrival Electric Vehicles. They were in the
      process of making electric vans, secured contracts with UPS and Royal
      Mail. Currently I'm down 98.7%... Ouch.


      The second was argo blockchain. Classic case of "FOMO".  I wanted exposure
      to crypto but was too fearful to buy an actual coin. So I opted for a
      bitcoin minor. They are still operational, but I am down about 85%....


      Valuable lessons learnt.

          @PositionHunter that said, if you look at the cumulative free cash
          flow burn for all of the EV companies, Tesla did a really, really good
          job, turning FCF positive in around a decade and never dropping to the
          depths of spend that all the other companies are now seeing.


          You could argue it is 1st mover, that the other companies are now
          having to invest more heavily to get into the market before Tesla have
          it sewn up, but they're not just spending more rapidly, they're
          spending far, far more in total than Tesla ever did (in terms of FCF).

          @PositionHunter I mean, the horse has well and truly bolted and the
          stable has now burned down, but.... I would see zero tech overlap
          between IBM and ARVL.


          Interestingly, ARVL is my biggest relative loss, but I don't see it as
          a regret - I wagered a little bit on a high-risk enterprise and got
          burned. But I don't regret it.

          @JamieUK123 it was - he used to work at IBM so I trusted he knew the
          tech. I think he was probably right there but as you say, execution
          wasn't going to happen.


          Argo terrifies me tbh. It's a bet on bitcoin and that seems to be
          entirely random.

          @PositionHunter me too (hence being invested!), but I think it's
          getting more risky, and by now I was expecting to be passing the
          high-risk point.... but I think next year is probably Peak Risk for
          the results of 5N4Y. Or, 4N4Y, as it is now!


          Sven has an interesting take, with INTC's "smart capital".... he likes

      Mine was Teladoc $TDOC I was convinced it would carve out a decent
      proportion of the care market as there were clear success stories coming
      out of the company and regularly mid 30% growth in the reports. When they
      announced their 18bn acquisition of Livongo - a company growing even
      faster I was sure we were going to end up with a new healthcare monster.
      What transpired was the worst integration I've ever seen. 18bn Livongo
      became almost zero growth and then almost zero business. 


      Teladoc floundered and then had to write off nearly the whole acquisition.
      The price fell from $300 or so to $60 and I followed it. I was in from
      around $200, I cut my losses, I lost my shirt. That was the correct
      decision, it's now $7.50. 


      The combined business was supposed to be worth 36bn, its now just over
      1bn.
